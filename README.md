# MMAE 350 — Computational Mechanics

This repository contains course materials for **MMAE 350: Computational Mechanics**
at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

The course introduces computational approaches used in modern engineering
analysis, with emphasis on linear systems, numerical methods, and their role
in modeling physical systems. Python and Jupyter notebooks are used throughout
the course as primary computational tools.

## Repository Organization

This repository is organized by **course modules**, with supporting materials
for homework, data, and software setup.

### Modules

The `modules/` directory contains the core instructional materials for the course.
Each module includes:
- a `README.md` describing the learning goals and context
- lecture slides (PDF)
- companion Jupyter notebooks

```
modules/
├── module00_setup/
├── module01_matrix_algebra/
├── module02_linear_systems/
└── ...
```

Students should begin each module by reading the module’s `README.md`.

---

### Homework

The `homework/` directory contains homework assignments and any associated
starter notebooks provided for students.

```
homework/
├── hw01/
├── hw02/
└── ...
```

Homework submissions are handled through **Canvas**, not through GitHub.

---

### Data

The `data/` directory contains shared input files used in demonstrations,
examples, or notebooks.

---

### Software Setup and Tools

The `tools/` directory contains supporting files related to the Python
environment and utility scripts used in the course.

Module 00 provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for installing Python,
creating a virtual environment, and configuring Jupyter.

---

### Instructor Source Files

The `tex/` directory contains LaTeX source files used to generate lecture
slides, homework PDFs, and the syllabus. These files are provided for
transparency and reproducibility but are not required for students to use.
