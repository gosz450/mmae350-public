# Module 01 — Computation and the Engineering Workflow

In this module, we introduce the role of computation in modern engineering
analysis and establish the **Python/Jupyter** workflow that will be used
throughout the course.

The emphasis is on how computational tools support **engineering thinking**,
modeling, and analysis — not on programming for its own sake. Computation is
treated as a means to express, explore, and solve engineering problems that
would be difficult or impractical to address analytically.

## Topics Covered

This module focuses on the practical foundations needed for computational
mechanics, including:

- The role of computation in modern engineering practice  
- The Python and Jupyter notebook workflow  
- Using notebooks as computational lab notebooks  
- Representing engineering problems computationally  
- Basic interaction with numerical libraries used throughout the course

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain how computation fits into the engineering analysis process  
- Use Jupyter notebooks as an interactive environment for exploration and documentation  
- Execute and modify Python code cells to evaluate engineering expressions  
- Interpret computational results in an engineering context

## Why This Module Matters

Computational tools are now an essential part of engineering practice.
They enable engineers to:

- analyze systems that cannot be solved in closed form  
- explore parameter sensitivity and “what-if” scenarios  
- connect mathematical models to physical behavior  

The workflow established in this module forms the foundation for all subsequent
modules, where computation is used to solve increasingly complex engineering
systems.
