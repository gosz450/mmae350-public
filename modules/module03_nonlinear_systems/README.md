## Module 3 Overview  
**Module 3: Nonlinear Systems and Continuum Foundations**


This module focuses on **Newton’s method** for systems of nonlinear equations.
Newton’s method is not simply a root-finding algorithm; it is the fundamental
mechanism by which nonlinear engineering problems are repeatedly linearized and
solved. Each Newton iteration requires the solution of a linear system involving
the Jacobian (or tangent) operator, making nonlinear solution strategies central
to computational mechanics, finite element analysis, and multiphysics
simulations.
