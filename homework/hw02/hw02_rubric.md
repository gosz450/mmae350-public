Homework 2 — Grading Rubric

MMAE 350 — Computational Mechanics
Spring 2026
Total: 10 points

⸻

Purpose

This homework emphasizes interpreting computational results and performance trends, rather than the mechanical details of implementation.

Grading focuses on a student’s ability to:
	•	present numerical results clearly,
	•	visualize performance behavior,
	•	and explain why different solvers behave as they do.

Minor numerical differences, plotting style choices, or formatting issues are not penalized if the overall trends and explanations are correct.

Grading Breakdown

Problem 1 — Results Tables: Accuracy and Runtime (3 points)

Evaluates clarity and completeness of reported numerical results.
	•	3 points
	•	Clearly presents tables reporting:
	•	runtime for all required methods and system sizes
	•	relative error compared to the reference solution
	•	Tables are readable, labeled, and organized so comparisons are clear.
	•	2 points
	•	Tables are mostly correct, but one method, system size, or label is missing
or unclear.
	•	1 point
	•	Incomplete or poorly organized tables, but some meaningful results are shown.
	•	0 points
	•	Tables missing or results not reported.

⸻

Problem 2 — Performance Plot: CPU Time vs. System Size (3 points)

Evaluates ability to visualize and compare solver performance.
	•	3 points
	•	Correct plot of CPU time versus system size n.
	•	Multiple methods are clearly distinguished with a legend.
	•	Axes are labeled with appropriate quantities and units.
	•	2 points
	•	Plot is present and mostly correct, but missing a label, legend, or clear distinction
between methods.
	•	1 point
	•	Plot included but incorrect, confusing, or poorly constructed.
	•	0 points
	•	Plot missing.

Notes
	•	Log–log plots are acceptable but not required.
	•	Plot aesthetics are not graded; clarity is the goal.

⸻

Problem 3 — Interpretation and Reflection Questions (4 points)

Evaluates conceptual understanding and written explanation.

Students respond to the four reflection questions provided in the assignment.
	•	4 points
	•	All questions are addressed clearly and correctly.
	•	Explanations demonstrate understanding of performance, scaling, and the role
of compiled versus loop-based solvers.
	•	Responses are written in complete sentences and refer meaningfully to the
reported results.
	•	3 points
	•	Mostly correct explanations, but one response is vague, superficial, or weakly
connected to the results.
	•	2 points
	•	Partial understanding shown, but multiple explanations are unclear or incomplete.
	•	1 point
	•	Minimal or largely descriptive responses with little interpretation.
	•	0 points
	•	Missing or fundamentally incorrect responses.

⸻

General Grading Guidance
	•	Focus on interpretation and reasoning, not numerical perfection.
	•	Small discrepancies in timing or error values are acceptable.
	•	Do not penalize plotting style, formatting, or minor technical issues.
	•	This assignment is intended to build intuition about algorithmic performance
and scaling, not to test optimization expertise.
