# Homework 1 — Grading Rubric  
**MMAE 350 — Computational Mechanics**  
Spring 2026  
Total: **10 points**

---

## Purpose

This homework is intentionally low-stakes. The primary goal is to ensure students
can successfully run a Jupyter notebook, make simple modifications, and interpret
computational results in an engineering context.

Grading emphasizes **understanding, interpretation, and workflow**, rather than
technical polish or programming sophistication.

## Grading Breakdown

### Problem 1 — What Is Computational Mechanics? (3 points)

Evaluates conceptual understanding and written explanation.

- **3 points**  
  - Clearly addresses all three prompts:
    - what computational mechanics is  
    - where computation enters the modeling process  
    - why interpretation or validation is necessary  
  - Responses are conceptually accurate, written in the student’s own words,
    and use full sentences.

- **2 points**  
  - Mostly correct, but one prompt is addressed weakly, vaguely, or incompletely.

- **1 point**  
  - Superficial responses or only one prompt meaningfully addressed.

- **0 points**  
  - Missing or fundamentally incorrect response.

### Problem 2 — Running and Modifying Notebook 01 (4 points)

Evaluates ability to run, modify, and interpret a Jupyter notebook.

- **4 points**  
  - Correctly computes and reports the total load.  
  - Successfully modifies the plotted function and includes the updated plot.  
  - Correctly increases the number of sampling points to 100 and includes the updated plot.  
  - Written explanations clearly describe how and why the plots change.

- **3 points**  
  - One minor issue (e.g., weak explanation, missing detail, or small error), but
    most tasks completed successfully.

- **2 points**  
  - Multiple issues, but clear evidence of running and modifying the notebook.

- **0–1 points**  
  - Little or no evidence of successful notebook execution or modification.

**Notes**
- Screenshots of plots are acceptable.
- Minor syntax or formatting issues are not penalized.
- Emphasis is on interpretation, not code elegance.

### Problem 3 — Interpretation of Linear Systems (3 points)

Evaluates understanding of numerical solution of linear systems.

- **3 points**  
  - Clearly explains what it means to solve a linear system numerically.  
  - Correctly identifies what quantity is being computed.  
  - Provides a reasonable explanation for why linear systems arise frequently
    in computational mechanics.

- **2 points**  
  - Mostly correct interpretation, but one explanation is vague or incomplete.

- **1 point**  
  - Minimal or unclear interpretation.

- **0 points**  
  - Missing or fundamentally incorrect response.

## General Grading Guidance

- Reward effort, engagement, and reasoning.
- Do not penalize stylistic Python issues.
- Focus on interpretation and computational thinking rather than correctness alone.
- This assignment is designed to support learning and confidence-building,
  not to test mastery.
